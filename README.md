## Predicting-Late-Deliveries-for-Olist-Brazilian-Ecommerce

E-commerce platforms like Olist face significant operational and reputational risks due to delayed deliveries, which can erode customer satisfaction and reduce repeat purchase behavior. Traditional approaches to managing delivery delays have relied on retrospective KPI tracking or static rule-based alerts, offering limited predictive capability. In this project, we propose a supervised machine learning approach to proactively predict the likelihood of late deliveries before they occur. By utilizing classification models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, we forecast delivery outcomes based on transactional, geographic, and behavioral features including shipping distances, gap between purchase and delivery, review scores, and carrier performance. Among the models tested, XGBoost emerged as the best fit for Olist’s business need: accurately flagging potentially late deliveries in advance to enable timely operational responses. Its ability to model non-linear interactions and manage feature importance makes it particularly effective in a dynamic retail logistics environment, offering clear potential to improve fulfillment precision and protect revenue.
